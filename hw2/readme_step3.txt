To generate step3.txt either of the following can be done:

1st option:
----------

* I already downloaded the sqlite repository from http://www.sqlite.org/download.html and
  created a git repo for the same after unzipping the zip file.

  (sqlite-src-3080600.zip)
  
  git repo is created here: https://github.com/grkrthk/test_suite

* Do not worry about the above step. Just invoke  "./step3_script". It
will clone the appropriate revision and executes the appropriate commands and
outputs all the test results into step3.txt

2nd option:
----------
* invoke "./step3_script_alternate". It will download the repo, unzip it,
  executes the test and creates step3.txt.

Both the scripts should be invoked on EWS machine.
